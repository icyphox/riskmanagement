Risk evaluation.
It mainly encompasses continuous monitoring on the effectiveness of the proposed, then implemented,
and finally deployed controls based on outcome of risk mitigation.
And it can also use threat intelligence tools or services to detect the new threats
and the vulnerability in the system.
It can trigger the next [inaudible] of risk assessment when existing risk is
above acceptable level or an emergent new risk is detected or identified.
The ultimate goal of the risk assessment is
to define the most important risk to the organization.
The goal of risk mitigation is then to determine what should be done to address them.
