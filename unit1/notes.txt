controls/safeguards - countermeasures to redce risk

in 1990's - 
	worms, open networks, systems w insecure configs.
(protection phase - vuln management)

in 2000's - 
	script kiddies, client side attacks that exploits vulns in web browser, messaging or streaming apps
(detection phase - threat management)

now, in 2010's - 
	maturing ecosystem, persistent target attacks (APT), DDoS, botnet, ransomware
(instant response - risk management)

no industry is immune to data loss

threats in 2020's - 
	* rise of attacks that cause irreversible harm
	* social engg. will become more prominent
	* nearly 50% of alerts and logs never invsetigated
	* dangers from and to the fast emerging AI systems
(age of resilience)

security solutions - 
	* remove attacker persistence - kill your own servers and reset your infrastructure (Netflix example)
	* easier or automated anomaly detection
	* built-in visibility
	* usable security to better mitigate SE attacks
	* learning to adapt to new attacker patterns
