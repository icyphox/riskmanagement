- risk = threat + vuln + asset
- risk is the probability of suffering a loss
- it can have positive effects (taking risk thingy)
- if the asset isn't worth much, the risk isn't high
- vuln is only one component of risk
- risk is a derived value, derived from the combination of the threat event in frequency, vulnerability and asset vaule and the libilty characterstics

- 3 phases
	* risk assesment
	* risk mitigation
	* risk evaulation

- iterative and proactive
- when an incident occurs, first contain the damage, then assess, determine the cause and then repair the damage, finally review response

- first approach to risk mgmt: reactive
- second approach: proactive
	* quantitative risk assesment
	* qualitative risk assesment

- common tools:
	* NIST Risk Management Framework
	* OCTAVE by Carnegie Mellon (workshop based not tool based)
	* FRAP (faster and simpler - ties risk to impact)
	* COBRA by C&A Systems Security in 1991 
	* RiskWatch
	* Fair (book)
- frameworks and standards
	* COBIT by ISACA
	* ISO 27001 and 27002

- risk assesment
	* scope out risks

- threat impact:
	* ALE = V x L
	* ALE is Annual Loss Exposure, V is value of an asset
	* L is likelihood
